## Scanning Statistics

- **Total Cities in Current List:** 50
- **Cities Scanned:** 1 (Warsaw)
- **Cities Remaining:** 49
- **Total Agencies Found:** 14 (from Warsaw scan)
- **Average Agencies per City:** ~14 (based on first scan)
- **Potential Total Agencies:** ~700 (if all cities yield similar results)

## Scanning Strategy

### Current Approach
- Process cities in batches of 5 per iteration
- Use 5 different prompts per city for comprehensive coverage
- Exclude already-known agencies to avoid duplicates
- Rate limiting: 1 second between prompts, 3 seconds between batches

### Polish Keywords Used
- **Agencies:** "biuro nieruchomości", "agencja nieruchomości", "firma nieruchomościowa"
- **Properties:** "nieruchomości", "własność", "mieszkanie", "dom", "apartament"
- **Locations:** "Costa del Sol", "Marbella", "Hiszpania", "Hiszpania nieruchomości"
- **Services:** "sprzedaż", "kupno", "inwestycja", "wynajem"

### Future Improvements
- Add more cities to the list (currently 50, could expand to 100+)
- Implement city prioritization based on Polish expatriate populations
- Add seasonal scanning (different results at different times)
- Track agency quality scores and contact success rates
- Implement parallel processing for faster scanning
- Add agency verification and contact validation
